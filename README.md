#studentIDCard#
An experiment in generating barcoded ID cards using only
the tools of the web.

##Warnings##
- We target Chrome browser, so cross-compaibility is not guarnteed.
- We're printing physical ID cards on a EDISecure printer using
ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1 sized cards (~86x54mm), so printer compatibility 
is not guaranteed.

... and while we do occassionally have our office staff fire this up, 
most of this code is destined for other projects. 

Still, we've found it very useful as a learning tool (and for actually
printing ID cards!)
